            <p>Baron Group is an enterpreneurial commercial real estate company with a 40-year track record of achieving outsized returns.</p>
            <p>We appreciate flexibility and avoid formulaic thinking to maximize value.</p>
            <p>This legacy extends back to <span class="font-weight-bold">Simeon D. Baron(esq)</span>, a visionary in a number of businesses including industrial real estate development.</p>
            <p>Simeon sold nearly 100 developments throughout the Gulf Coast region until 1998 when he sold the company along with a substantial portion of the portfolio, but his spirit of innovation still remain in our DNA, literally and figuratively.</p>
            <p>we often recognize value others overlook. Our financial strength and expertise allows us to act decisively; quickly vetting oppurtunities, closing on the majority of properties contracted to purchase, and consistently generating good returns.</p>
            <p>We are thankful for our business success, and feel passionate about giving back to the communities we serve.</p>
